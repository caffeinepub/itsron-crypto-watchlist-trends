  "architectural_notes": [
    "Frontend depends on a cached backend canister ID (e.g., in localStorage); actor creation can stall if the cached ID is missing/wiped and auto-discovery does not run.",
    "Backend canister `itsron_crypto_backend` exposes `getLiveMarketData(symbol)` and will add a `debugFetchCoinGecko(symbol)` function that performs an HTTP outcall to the CoinGecko URL builder and returns the raw response for debugging.",
    "Need an explicit, persistent environment/mode configuration (demo vs live) and a clear path to deploy/verify the live mode in the hosted Caffeine environment.",
    "Caffeine environment has no terminal/dfx access for the user; CoinGecko raw-response validation must be done via an in-app UI/tester flow that calls canister methods and renders the returned raw response (and any surfaced debug info).",
    "HTTPS outcalls to CoinGecko require cycles; backend must monitor cycle balance and maintain sufficient cycles (e.g., via auto top-ups) to avoid IC0504 rejections in production.",
    "Add Crypto dialog should fetch the available coin/symbol list from the backend `validSymbols` map and provide a searchable Symbol Picker UI; selecting a symbol calls `addCryptoToWatchlist` and triggers an immediate UI refresh of watchlist/dashboard state."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Clearing browser cache/cookies can wipe the cached backend canister ID, causing the app to remain stuck on “Connecting to backend” (actor never begins fetching; stage remains idle) even when Internet Identity is authenticated.",
    "Coverage report indicates `debugFetchCoinGecko` has not been added to `backend/main.mo` yet despite a deployment; needs implementation + redeploy + test.",
    "Backend canister ran out of cycles, causing IC0504 rejection on CoinGecko HTTPS outcalls and breaking live market data for all symbols until cycles are replenished.",
    "Watchlist price ticks section is still hard-coded to always show “Coming Soon” and is not wired to live market data (no `useGetLiveMarketData()` per symbol / no watchlist-to-symbol binding)."
