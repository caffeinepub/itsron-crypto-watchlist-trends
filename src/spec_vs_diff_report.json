  "summary": "Diff partially addresses Backend Tester behavior by adding scroll/auto-scroll state in SimulatedBashPanel and introducing a per-command `mode: 'live' | 'demo'` field in backendTesterCommands, but the provided changes do not clearly implement the full scrolling acceptance criteria or the required accurate live-vs-demo user-facing messaging.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the Backend Tester bottom output panel so it reliably scrolls (mouse wheel/trackpad, scrollbar drag, and touch) when command output exceeds the visible height, in both normal and maximized window states; ensure output panel doesn't get stuck due to parent overflow/height constraints; maintain auto-scroll-to-bottom only when user is at bottom.",
      "reason": "The diff shows new refs/state and an auto-scroll effect, but does not show any concrete container styling/structure changes (e.g., overflow/height constraints) needed to guarantee wheel/drag/touch scrolling in both normal and maximized states, and the auto-scroll logic is truncated so the 'only when at bottom' behavior cannot be verified from the summary.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Update the Backend Tester UI and command definitions so messaging accurately reflects live vs demo behavior; clearly indicate which commands are Live vs Demo; ensure banner/note and command list are consistent; remove misleading API-source mentions.",
      "reason": "While a `mode` field was added to `CommandDefinition`, the shown commands are still marked `mode: 'demo'` with descriptions like \"Demo mode - uses simulated data\" and there is no evidence in the diff summary of Backend Tester UI banner/note text being updated to avoid generic 'demo mode' messaging or to display Live/Demo indicators consistently in the command list.",
